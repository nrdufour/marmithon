# Marmithon

A simple IRC bot that I maintain for friends.

Features so far:
+ config file to connect and nickname
+ basic systems of commands, especially for ATC (to be redone)
+ based on the great irc package <https://github.com/whyrusleeping/hellabot>
+ shows the title on any given url in the channel
